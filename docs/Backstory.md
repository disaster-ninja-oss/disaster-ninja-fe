## Backstory

On Friday Feb 22nd 2019 a 7.5 earthquake hit Peru, Ecuador and Colombia.

A homebrew callback posted that from GDACS system into #general channel on Humanitarian OSM Team (HOT) slack.

HOT started the Activation process. Using random tools people tried to figure out:
* how many people are really affected (president of Equador said "no casualties" on TV, Twitter has photos of destroyed homes).
* is there OpenStreetMap data of good quality available in affected area, and if not - how much is there to map.
* what administrative units are affected (is that really all three countries or just a small part of it).
* what are on the ground organizations to ask about what is really happening there, and where they need help with the map as the first priority.

Afterwards a set of tasks for volunteers were created in HOT Tasking manager interface, where volunteers continually improve the map in affected areas.

They got all this information within an hour waking up roughly 7 people. We believe we can help them do it faster.
