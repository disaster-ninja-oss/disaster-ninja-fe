What does **Disaster Ninja** do?

Disaster.Ninja dashboard helps emergency cartographers prepare mapping tasks in minutes instead of hours by:

1. Disaster alerts notifications sending to [**HOT**](https://www.hotosm.org/)**\*** Slack.
2. Automated determination of factors for appropriate response:
   1. The type, scope, and anticipated humanitarian impact of the event are evaluated.
   2. The current state of OSM data and imagery available in the area of interest is reviewed to determine needs and the assistance HOT can provide.
   3. Local OSM communities are identified as well as top local OSM contributors.
3. Demonstration of all OSM available local-specific area images.
4. Determination and visualization of mapping quality through bivariate map layers:
   1. Showing map data lacks by comparing OSM objects quantity to the population of the area.
   2. Showing map data recentness compared to the area views.
* *\*HOT** (Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team) is an international team dedicated to*

*humanitarian action and community development through open mapping.*

*HOT Activation Leads are people responsible for initializing [HOT Activation Protocol](https://www.hotosm.org/downloads/HOTActivationProtocol.pdf), meaning going through steps from alert processing to engaging OSM volunteers to react to a catastrophe accordingly if needed.*

What impact does **Disaster Ninja** do?

The speed of reaction is crucial in disaster management. It used to take 7-12 hours for HOT to go through Activation Protocol. This time is optimized to a \~15 minutes procedure by automation of processes, the introduction of bivariate layers, and gathering all the required info into one interface.
